New York Housing Prices Prediction

This project is a simple linear regression model built using Python to analyze and predict housing prices in New York over time. The dataset is sourced from Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) and has been preprocessed to transform date values into a numeric format for regression analysis.

Features

Dataset: Zillow housing price index for New York (processed for regression analysis)

Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting dates to numerical values

Model: Simple Linear Regression

Goal: Predict future home prices based on historical trends
